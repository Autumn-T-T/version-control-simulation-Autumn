I created the branches to create proper segments in my html. Using: 
$git checkout -b (insert branch name) to add new branches
$git add index.html to stage my changes
$git commit -m to commit my changes.
From there I would do the following
git checkout main > git merge (insert previous branch I was at) > fixing conflicts and recommitting and then from there pushing the origin main I did that a few times till I felt I was satisfied with my work. I had to redo this a few times myself because I either broke something (haha) or felt like it didn't look good enough and I honestly might go back and touch up on it a bit more with css as just a fun little thing to do myself!
